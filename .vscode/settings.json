In some contexts, the first line is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body. The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the two together.\n\nWrite your commit message in the present tense: \"Fix bug\" and not \"Fixed bug.\" This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.\n\nFurther paragraphs come after blank lines.\n\nBullet points are okay, too\nTypically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here\nUse a hanging indent"
